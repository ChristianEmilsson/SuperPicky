## Post Body

Hi r/photography!

I’m an indie developer and avid bird photographer. We all know the struggle: you go out for a shoot, come back with 5,000+ RAW files, and then spend hours culling them just to find the few keepers where the eye is sharp and the composition is good.

I built **SuperPicky** to solve this for myself, and I’ve just released **Version 4.0.3** with some major updates. It’s a macOS app designed specifically to speed up your culling workflow before you even import into Lightroom.

### ✨ What does it actually do?

SuperPicky analyzes your RAW/JPG files locally (privacy-first) and automatically groups burst shots. It then scores them based on:

*   **Focus Quality**: Checks if the subject (especially the eye) is sharp.
*   **Exposure**: Flags blown-out highlights or crushed shadows.
*   **Composition**: Analyzes framing.
*   **[NEW] AI Bird ID**: It can now identify bird species offline and write the name into EXIF metadata!

### 🚀 What's new in V4?

*   **Photography Skill Levels**: You can now tell the AI your experience level (Beginner/Expert), and it will adjust its strictness accordingly.
*   **Lightroom Integration**: A new plugin that allows seamless metadata sync.
*   **Native Apple Silicon Support**: Blazing fast on M1/M2/M3 chips.
*   **Offline AI**: No internet connection needed for culling or bird ID.
